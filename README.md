# js-canvas
All projects with js canvas from scratch. Only minimal usage of libraries like "perlin noise" or "p5js" (very minimal usage).

### info
The setup.js file contains sometimes interesting helper functions also for general programming.

### updates
This wil be updated a lot.

### future
The idea is to put images in each project folder of the project.

### About
The idea was to code art, but as I'm not very fimiliar with the methametics and ints philosophy,
this made a big learn curve for me.

### Why js?
All in good time c++.
