###### Ants the game
(use ant simulation code in C#, http://www.emilianocristiani.it/myrmedrome/main_en.html)

# concept
a bit like age of empires+civilasation, but than with ants
fight other ant colonies and conquer more terretory

An only multiplayer game, like clash of clans, where ant colonies join force to break others or enslaveeach other





# gamplay
## setup
You chose a type of colony in a selection of all types, each kind has its own strength and weaknesses
    eg. 
    â€¢ bullet ant: 
        Technical:
            slow to hatching and but do a lot of damage and are faster. 
        Tips:
            Is a fearce colony to be recond with, you better keep him as an ally.
        Tactics:
            Good for long distance fast surprise attacks.

Then you select a zone on a map the size of the earth (maybe 1st version only south-america or brazil).
The locations are terretories. You also see vage colored parts with the flag some giant colonies of other players.
you can only select from dark zones "unknown terretories". 
- design option: player start location
    1. you select a unknown terretory and get a small 'randomly' assigned part in that zone. 
    2. you get an autoassigned zone

You can now make you own clan name[1]. And then you enter the game..


[1] there can be multiple same clan name, but you give a short name (global name), like "Kod&Scotch". 
But the long unique name (id) need to be unique eg. "Prenounces kod-n-skotch" 

## start

You will see a small colony; a single queen and a bunch (depending on type of colony) of workers ant, around a center hole/hill (type of colony).
Indicators will tell you to gather resources from your serroundings. And produce more ants.
- lvl 0:
    When you have gathered a certain amount of food the queen can start to produce hatchlings (!dont forget in the start!).
    A certain score will go up, like the level of your civilasation.

- lvl 5:
    And you will be able to build structures and tunnels to gather and store more resources, until you start to get a smooth economy (this should be gameplay as well).

- lvl 10:
    A couple of levels higher, you can start to produce (not realistic to ant) monitors. These are AI ants that assign tasks to worker ants and so automate a lot of arbritary taks for the user, for he is going to be bussy on a new level.

- lvl 15:
    Now you can start to produce more advances architects AI's, who can control ants to build more complicated infrastructures,
    Like a storage depo which has a long tunnel straight to the queen. You can also now produce first soldiers  type_1 ants[2] and explorers.

    type_1 soldier ants are used for guarding or havy contruction tasks or even attacking enemy workers, but no match for type_2.
    Explorer ants are bigger and have a good stamina and can so travel and explore deeper parts.
    These deeper parts are inneccesable for normal worker ants as they need food (also need to return to mother hole every x- time, other players will colonies very far places as a small colonie. you need a good supply chain and multiple queens/bases for that)

- lvl 20:
    You have a vast economy and descovered other players by far scouting you serroundings. Now you can produce type_2 worriour ants who can kill other ants with ease (in 1v1). Or you can build economic trade routes together and join forces. 


Options towards other player:
    1. they give each other 3% of all hatchling to the other. Or like 300. who will be slaves to the other. As handshake.
        This promotes trust in you relationship, which brings less innacuracy for working ants who work together.
    2. You just agree. But less trust.

    3. you become part of the other clan: this is done by again serving n hatchinglings to the other. And you control your ants,    but they are under the same banner, but he can also control you if he wants to.

    4. You wiped him out. he's game over but his ants live now for you or are executed.
    
    5. you don't go near him, or you egnore each other. But these have no benifits.

Going to war:
    going to war drains ants and economy, so it required vast resources and good way of control [3] and a practiced player.
    If not watched well, enemy ants might steal/kill your hatchlings. which can be catrastophic to you next-gen economy. 

    you can build defenive structures, or deeper holes in the ground (level up defence button) towards big enemies.
    While big enemies can try to destroy your still small conolie, they need a lot more resources to attack than to defend.
    Unless afcourse they have a big bullet ant army that hanibals through the jungle, but this is very expensive and should not be computed as being overlord.

    The benifits of destroying other players can be terretory (more food). Or vast recources to boost yout economy. Or political, maybe if you destroy that player you can join a certain clan or you can go to a place beyond that exatcly has the recource you need to produce a big economy.

- lvl 30:
    Now you can start making everything bigger, better, stronger (trump). Better automation for ease of play. 
    A second queen that can control a 2nd home.
    You can also now teach you ants certain skills: making rafts, climing threes, eating through wood. 
    
    These skills are the unique skills of each civilasation and you can now start to train maybe a couple in total, to a generation fo ants. Next generations can optionally be learned others, but only a flew, like 3 skill max.
    If ants have long had a skill, the skill becomes bigger but is also harded for next generation to learn another if they wanted to change.

    Now you also start to exlpore vast and very different terretories. Depending on type of ant and it's skills, economy might prospor in some terretories but not in others.

-  lvl 30 or beyond:
    Now it's time to go crazy and conquer a vast terretory. But this can't be be controlled by you alone, and so you need to accept other players under you hood and become the king of kings. If you would only streth out your colony, you would have a lot of trouble/time to control is well as the AI does not do everything as planned forever or they forget commands, idk.

    The game becomes now very political and no guirilla fighting only well prepared empire clashes, with general and lords all being assigned to troops you gave them to control.
    And big economic wars of food sources and water supplies.

    ... beyond ...
    Now you can say; i beat the game. You have generals fighting your wars and politicians ruling you clan, and you enjoying the porfits. Other clan members only getting what them is given.

- design idea: AI of orders
    1. the player is soley resonsible for paying the promised monthly homage to his overlord clan leader.
    2. you can implement an automation for this with a diplomatic ant type.



- optional:
    there are humans and animals. They all life in their terretories, but can also be conquerored with big enough armies.
    Animals or rain can for exmaple detroy part of your colonie, handeling these dangers, eg. not attacking the human when you are a small player.




[2] maybe you can do that from the beginning as well, but it would ruin your economy as they need a lot of food.
[3] control over ants might even be to become a sort of democrasy like in civilasations.


## control
You control you ants not with big accuracy and they move on AI you are just giving them ort of a direction => MAYBE
                            -- OR--
You control the via the queen only. the asks for things and then they work => NO
                            -- OR--
Best idea might be to cheat and assign iteligent ants


## money
- each week you get one free day. this can be used to pause the game for a day and is automated (and in beginning unable to be attacked). You can buy extra days.
- You wait or pay real money to hatch more eggs.
- These eggs are produces by the queen who needs a lot of food, food drops can be bought.
- you can buy cool skins for ants, and build a complete (but expensive) custom city.
