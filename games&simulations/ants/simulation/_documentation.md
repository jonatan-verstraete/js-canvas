# HOW ANT MOVE
(Temnothorax albipennis ants)

### ABOUT ANTS
• eusocial organism that are very community-oriented and behave as a group instead of as individuals
• females:
    - all ant workers are female and share 75% of their DNA with queen and are okey with only queen producing next gen

• males:
    - one genome copy means every one of their sperm is genetically identical to themselves. And their job is over quickly, dying soon after mating.
    - life for a week

# QUEEN:
• to female ants: 
    - pheromones are produced by the queen ant that make the female worker ants physically unable to reproduce.
    The queens produce a pheromone which is then picked up by the antennae of the worker:
    - The antennae sense the pheromone and through the activity of hormonal pathways, there are signals that cause the ant to be sterile. + decreased worker aggression
    => when queen is hurt, females become furtile again because pheromones drops

    - eg. race. worker ant with the highest ovary activation will start producing the queen control pheromones and replace the injured queen.

• to males:

• to other queen:
    - fights to death with other queen









### SENSES
antenna: touch and smell
they leave chemicals in traces unique to each colony

ants smell of the food thehave found as way oftelling other ants what's out there

### SPEED
the walking speed of an ant changes after interaction with other ants, where the change depends on the speed of the second ant.

it has been suggested that a building up in speed, following the interaction with fast returning foragers, might be the basis of an ant's decision to leave the nest for a foraging trip


more ants enter the nest, the faster they move.
-> more ants are in motion in the arena, the faster they move

2 tendencies:
if the ant is moving, then it will speed up in the next time step
whenever it starts moving, it will do it with an average speed of the order of v*


the higher the speed, the less likely the next move will increase in speed




# ? 
ants' bursts of activity moving both inside and outside their colony's nest exhibit a power-law relation between the duration of the activity and its average speed.

obey a universal speed shape profile. The authors concluded that this predictability implies that the duration of each ant's movement is ‘somehow determined before the movement itself


### DIRECTION
discontinuous and irregular, eventually stopping and restarting their walk

- Workers exit the colony random


### THINKING
The ant's actions are based on local decisions
d indirect communication between the ants. This is what is usually
called emergent behavior
