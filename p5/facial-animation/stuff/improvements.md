this is all done without any help or papers that are on the internet on facial detection or methods that are used
partly because i wonbt understand the math and partly lazyness but mostly stubourness and exitment of finding out how and why and not only adhearing the solution from others or a python import.



METHOD 1



upgrades:
- intead of filtering out points that are too populated, get the media/middle line in between them
- detect each facial part seperatly


METHOD 2
!!! works reverse 
- first have a skeleton of where the parts of a face are
- then look around those point for possible colour & shapes
